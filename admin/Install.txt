Install notes for Qserv:

	There are a number of required software packages for the use of Qserv.  Notes on
	the current software requirements and download of source codes for use can be
	found at:

	http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/qserv/download

	Please see the web page there, and get all the software that you require for
	your system.


Server setup for Qserv:

	You will need to define which production user qserv will run under, it is
	not suggested to run qserv as root.  Login to your production user, and 
	define the install dir which will be used.  The initial default is to put
	all data in use for the database in this same dir, so make sure there will
	be enough space for the data to be served.  
	
	In this install dir, download all source packages from the qserv download
	page.  These should be put into a subdir call "build".
	
	Once all package files are there, untar the qserv tar into the install dir,
	this will give you a subdir named like "qserv-0.3.0".  Then rename this
	subdir to just "qserv".
	
	Using the install dir as your current working dir, then run the
	"qserv-install" script from the qserv admin dir.  This will unpackage all
	the source code, compile it for your machine, and setup and configure it for
	use.  This will take 20 mins or so, but will finish with an installed and
	configured qserv server for use.
	
	Example inital setup:
	
	cd <install dir>
	mkdir build
	<copy all download package from qserver download page to build>
	tar zxf build/qserv-0.3.0rc3.tar.gz
	mv qserv-0.3.0 qserv
	./qserv/admin/qserv-install
	
Control of Server:

	One the software compiles, the control of the server is managed by the
	qserv-admin script.  This is an executable binary in the bin dir in the
	install dir, it would be good to make sure this is in the path for your
	executing shell.
	
	You can start the components of the qserv server with:
	
	qserv-admin --start
	
	And shut down the server with
	
	qserv-admin --stop
	
Loading of data:

	The setup scripts at this time are setup to make the loading of "pt11" test
	data easy.  If you have other data you want qserv to handle, please contact
	the developers, and the management scripts can be extended.
	
	To load data, you start with the raw dump of the data from a bare mysql
	database.  This first needs to be partitioned into "chunks", based on
	positions in the sky.  The paritioning of the pt11 data can be done with:
	
	qserv-admin --partition --source <path to pt11 data) --output <path to partioned data> --table <table name>

	For now the tables in the dataset are 'Object' or 'Source'.
	
	To then load this data into the load mysql database for use in qserv you
	can do with:
	
	qserv-admin --load --source <path to pt11 data) --output <path to partioned data> --table <table name>

	This will setup the local qserv server to host this data for testing.

Further Info:

	For further and more detailed notes please see the qserv_install_long.txt
	docs.  This should explain in more detail what the install proceedure is
	doing.
