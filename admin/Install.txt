Install notes for Qserv:

	There are a number of required software packages for the use of Qserv.  Notes on
	the current software requirements and download of source codes for use can be
	found at:

	http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/qserv/download

	Please see the web page there, and get all the software that you require for
	your system.


Server setup for Qserv:

	You will need to define which production user qserv will run under, it is
	not suggested to run qserv as root.  Login to your production user, and 
	define the install dir which will be used.  The initial default is to put
	all data in use for the database in this same dir, so make sure there will
	be enough space for the data to be served.  
	
	In this install dir, download all source packages from the qserv download
	page.  These should be put into a subdir call "build".
	
	Once all package files are there, untar the qserv tar into the install dir,
	this will give you a subdir named like "qserv-0.3.0".  Then rename this
	subdir to just "qserv".
	
	Using the install dir as your current working dir, then run the
	"qserv-install" script from the qserv admin dir.  This will unpackage all
	the source code, compile it for your machine, and setup and configure it for
	use.  This will take 20 mins or so, but will finish with an installed and
	configured qserv server for use.
	
	Example inital setup:
	
	cd <install dir>
	mkdir build
	<copy all download package from qserver download page to build>
	tar zxf build/qserv-0.3.0rc1.tar.gz
	mv qserv-0.3.0 qserv
	./qserv/admin/qserv-install
