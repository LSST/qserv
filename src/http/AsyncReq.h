/**
 * Class AsyncReq represents a simple asynchronous interface for
 * communicating over the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * The implementation of the class invokes a user-supplied callback (lambda) function
 * upon a completion or a failure of the request. The class has two versions of the factory
 * methods illustrated below.
 *
 * Here is an example of using the class to pull a file and dump its content on
 * to the standard output stream using a static URL of the file:
 * @code
 *   boost::asio::io_service io_service;
 *   std::shared_ptr<AsyncReq> const reader =
 *       http::AsyncReq::create(
 *           [](auto const& reader) {
 *               if (reader->state() != http::AsyncReq::State::FINISHED) {
 *                   std::cerr << "request failed, state: " << AsyncReq::state2str(reader->state())
 *                        << ", error: " << reader->errorMessage() << std::endl;
 *                   return;
 *               }
 *               cout << reader->responseBody();
 *           },
 *           io_service,
 *           http::Method::GET, "http://my.host.domain/data/chunk_0.txt");
 *   });
 *   reader->start();
 *   io_service.run();
 * @code
 *
 * The next example is an illustration of using the dynamically retrieved values
 * of the connection parameters (as needed by the implementation of the class).
 * In this example, a client provides a function that returns a different combination
 * of host/port.
 * @code
 *   std::vector<AsyncReq::HostPort> const hostPort = {
 *       AsyncReq::HostPort{"host-a", 8080},
 *       AsyncReq::HostPort{"host-b", 8081},
 *       AsyncReq::HostPort{"host-c", 8082},
 *       AsyncReq::HostPort{"host-d", 8083}
 *   };
 *   size_t next = 0;
 *   AsyncReq::GetHostPort const getHostPort = [&hostPort, &next]() -> AsyncReq::HostPort {
 *       return hostPort[next++ % hostPort.size()];
 *   };
 *   boost::asio::io_service io_service;
 *   std::shared_ptr<AsyncReq> const reader =
 *       http::AsyncReq::create(
 *           [](auto const& reader) {
 *               if (reader->state() != http::AsyncReq::State::FINISHED) {
 *                   std::cerr << "request failed, state: " << AsyncReq::state2str(reader->state())
 *                        << ", error: " << reader->errorMessage() << std::endl;
 *                   return;
 *               }
 *               cout << reader->responseBody();
 *           },
 *           io_service,
 *           http::Method::GET, getHostPort, "/data/chunk_0.txt");
 *   });
 *   reader->start();
 *   io_service.run();
 * @code
 *
 * The client class can also be used for synchronized wait for the completion of
 * a request. All that is needed here is to call the method AsyncReq::wait() any time
 * after creating the request. The method can be call within the same thread:
 * @code
 *   std::shared_ptr<AsyncReq> const request = http::AsyncReq::create(...);
 *   request->start();
 *   ...
 *   request->wait();
 * @code
 *
 * Waiting could be also done from some other thread:
 * @code
 *   std::shared_ptr<AsyncReq> const request = http::AsyncReq::create(...);
 *   std::thread t([request]() {
 *       request->wait();
 *       if (request->state() != http::AsyncReq::State::FINISHED) {
 *           std::cerr << "request failed, state: " << AsyncReq::state2str(request->state())
 *                     << ", error: " << request->errorMessage() << std::endl;
 *           return;
 *       }
 *       cout << request->responseBody();
 *   });
 *   ...
 *   request->start();
 * @code
 *
 * @note Once the start() method gets called w/o throwing an exception, the algorithm
 *   can make repeated attempts to establish a connection to the Web server even if
 *   the server's host and/or port won't be resolved, or if the connection attempts
 *   will be failing, or if attempts to send a request will be failing. A short delay
 *   will be introduced after each unsuccessfull attempt. The request will go into
 *   the FAILED state if 1) there will be a failure in receiving server's response,
 *   2) in case of incorrect data received from the server, or 3) the result is too
 *   large.
 *
 * @note If the request was created using an alternative technique that require passing
 *   the AsyncReq::GetHostPort function then the function will get called before
 *   any attmpt to establish a connection to the specified target. The technique allows
 *   changing the destination of a request to a different server should the previous one
 *   failed to respond.
 *
 * @note The implementation will open and close a new connection for each request.
 * @note The implementation doesn't support TLS/SSL-based HTTPS protocol.
