/**
 * Class ObjectIndex is a singleton serving as a front-end to a specific implementation of
 * the "secondary" index.
 *
 * Objects of the class can be open in two modes:
 * - WRITE: for writing into an index file at the specified location.
 * - READ: reading from an index via the specified source.
 *
 * Files written in the WRITE mode are open in the "append" mode, hence their previos
 * content won't be truncated. It's up to a client to ensure the files get removed if
 * the clean starting state is required.
 *
 * The source specification in the READ node is a URL-style resource. Presently, only the file-based
 * resource is supported. Hence, the file URL is expected
 * to look like this:
 * @code
 *   file:///<path-to-the-index-file>
 * @code
 * Normally the path specified in the resource would be a file which was produced
 * in the WRITE mode. The path could have a relative or absolute value. It could also be
 * located on a local or remote filesystem. Since the file would be read sequentially then
 * no specific requirements for file locking or direct access are imposed by this implemenation.
 *
 * All methods of the class are thread-safe.
