# file: README

#   This folder contains instructions and tools for building a runnable container
#   packed with the Replication System's binaries and their dependent libraries
#
# Go into a development folder where you normally build Qserv (by running
# the scons tool)

cd /home/<user>/development/qserv

# Run the following script that will collect dependencies (libraries into
# a temporary folder) and build a container tagged with the specified tag.
# Examples below making a tag based on the git hash.
#
# Note the optional flag that would tell the script that a definition of
# the current user is found in the system's files:
#
#   /etc/passwd
#   /etc/group
#
# Without the flag the script will expected similar files be found at
# the user's home folder:
#
#   ~/passwd
#   ~/group
#
# User definition is needed to run the Docker container collecting dependencies
# under the current user.

TAG="qserv/replica:tools-$(git describe --dirty --always)" 

# For a case when no user entry exists in the local /etc/passwd, /etc/group
# files.
admin/tools/docker/replication/container/tools/build.sh $PWD "$TAG"

# If a user entry is present in /etc/passwd, /etc/group.
admin/tools/docker/replication/container/tools/build.sh $PWD "$TAG" --local-user
